Adminer is a database management tool, similar to phpMyAdmin, but it's a single PHP file that you can easily deploy. Here are the steps to install Adminer on an Ubuntu server using the terminal:

## Update Your Package List:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
## Install PHP (if not already installed):

Adminer requires PHP, so if you don't have it installed, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
```

## Create a Directory for Adminer:

You need to place the Adminer file in a directory accessible by your web server. A common location is <code>/var/www/html</code>.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/adminer
```

## Download Adminer:

Download the latest version of Adminer. You can do this with wget.

```bash
sudo wget -O /var/www/html/adminer/adminer.php https://www.adminer.org/latest.php
```

## Set the Appropriate Permissions:

Make sure the web server has the appropriate permissions to access the Adminer file.

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/adminer
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/adminer
```

## Restart Apache:

Restart the Apache web server to ensure all changes take effect.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Access Adminer:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://your_server_ip/adminer/adminer.php. You should see the Adminer login page. To know the IP of your server,

```bash
hostname -I
```
